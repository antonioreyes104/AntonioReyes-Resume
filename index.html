        <p class="lead mb-4">Hi, my name is Antonio Reyes and I am studying chemistry hoping to become a Pharmacologist. However, I did not always want to become a Pharmacologist. Throughout most of my life, I had a passion for basketball. Inspired by some of the basketball greats, I practiced every day and every night to be like one of them. Every time I stepped on the court I felt the joy and excitement of the ball dribbling, the ball swishing through the net, and screeches of sneakers on the hardwood floors. I have always dreamed of playing basketball in high school and in college. Unfortunately, during high school, I didnâ€™t make the team. I was so distraught and lost the passion for the game. At that moment, I didnâ€™t feel I was cut out for the basketball game.
<br><br>

        After hanging up the sneakers and hanging up my jersey, I decided to try swimming. During tryouts I noticed that I was one of the slowest swimmers, but I kept trying my best to catch up to the other swimmers. At the end of the tryouts, I managed to make the swim team with my determination. So from then on, I decided to work hard and practice my skills to improve my speed in the pool. I practiced every morning, after school, weekends. I started to love swimming and enjoy the competition. At the end of the season I managed to drop 4 seconds on my 50m freestyle and 50m butterfly. After the first season, I knew that swimming was the sport I would enjoy the rest of my life. However a month before the start of my second season, I dislocated my shoulder while playing intramural frisbee. It was the most painful injury I had ever suffered. The athletic director had told me that I needed surgery if I wanted to compete in swimming again. He also told me that I could also just strengthen my shoulder but even then there was a high chance I could dislocate my shoulder again. I took the risk and decided to strengthen my shoulder in the weight room and improve my shoulderâ€™s mobility for a month before the season. Unfortunately, during the first week of practice, all the strengthening and stretching did not work, as I dislocated my shoulder in the pool. At that moment I knew it was time for me to stop and discontinue the swim season.
<br><br>

       That terrible injury had forced me to retire from swimming, so I just focused on my school work and volunteering at food drives. I then began taking an interest in chemistry and pharmacy. From the exciting labs and witnessing some explosions that my teacher demonstrated, I wanted to learn more and was excited to go to chemistry class. My teacher, who used to be a pharmacist, inspired me to be a pharmacist and be able to do hands-on labs to make medications and drugs. Just hearing the stories wanted me to pursue pharmacy. I learned that chemistry was more than just fun and exciting hands-on labs, but it was the concepts and the mixtures that made it even more interesting. From my misfortunes in basketball and swimming, I began to see a new light and excitement for chemistry and pharmacy.
